## Project
### Movie in one
* I usually consider the score and reviews of a film before I go to the cinema. However, the score of some Chinese movies are unavailable in one place, therefore I decided to build my own movie review website, which combined TMDB api and Douban api using React, react-router, react-redux, Sass and webpack.
